# 🍅 Tomato — Immutable Work Repository

> **A simple, transparent, and tamper-proof way to record completed work submissions on the blockchain.**

---

## 🧩 Project Description

**Tomato** is a lightweight **Solidity smart contract** that serves as an **immutable repository** for storing completed work references such as **IPFS CIDs**, **GitHub links**, or any verifiable identifiers.

Once a submission is added, it is **permanent**, **publicly viewable**, and **cannot be edited or deleted**, ensuring full transparency and integrity.

This project is perfect for:
- Developers and freelancers who want on-chain proof of work  
- Students submitting projects or assignments immutably  
- Teams tracking verified deliverables on the blockchain
